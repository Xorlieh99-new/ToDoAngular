- Our app component will deal with to do items, using two of Angular's directives. 
- *ngIf and *ngFor to dynamically alter the structure of the DOM.
- We'll use the *ngFor directive for creating DOM elements based on items in an array.
- We'll use *ngIf to add or remove elements from the DOM based on a condition. 
- We'll share data between components using decorators, @Input and @Output.
- We have a item object model created in item.ts, this means our item is an object that has a description and can be done.
